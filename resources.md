None of this is gospel; it represents merely a _starting point_. Many of these are a little bit older, which is a virtue: you can follow a citation thread to see how current thinking has evolved. One helpful thing to do when you are given a set of possibilities like this is to drop them into something like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [Open Alex](https://openalex.org/), or [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) (there are other options) to see who has cited a work, and how it has been used.

Keep track of what you've read using [zotero.org](https://zotero.org). Use its built-in pdf reader to annotate and mark up what you've read. Use its citation management features when it comes time to write something developed from your reading notes!
