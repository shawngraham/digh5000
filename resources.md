Given your interests in the various topics you have selected for your day to lead the group, I have compiled a variety of materials together for you. None of this is gospel; it represents merely a _starting point_. Many of these are a little bit older, which is a virtue: you can follow a citation thread to see how current thinking has evolved. One helpful thing to do when you are given a set of possibilities like this is to drop them into something like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [Open Alex](https://openalex.org/), or [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) (there are other options) to see who has cited a work, and how it has been used.

Keep track of what you've read using [zotero.org](https://zotero.org). Use its built-in pdf reader to annotate and mark up what you've read. Use its citation management features when it comes time to write something developed from your reading notes!

Below I've gathered together resources that I think might help you, and I've tagged them with a broad theme they might speak to. Again, this is non-exhaustive. And you'll also note that my citation style is all over the place. Yes. That's because I piled these here as I worked on other things. The key thing is that you can follow through the links or otherwise quickly get to the piece. Some things might be paywalled. If you have any troubles, let me know.

Double-click a theme with your mouse, ctrol+v to copy it, ctrl+F to open the search in your browser, ctrl+v to paste it in and search!

+ [The Data-Sitters Club](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/) explore several of the animating ideas, technologies, and approaches of DH through a sustained investigation of a large corpus of young-adult novels published in the 1990s. Strongly recommended.

+ Several openly available volumes in the 'Debates in the Digital Humanities' series have been published; you should really explore [what is on offer](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/). #overview

+ [Reviews in DH](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/) is a publication that evaluates and shares current DH projects. Explore this publication for works that are of interest to you. Pay attention to the design and technology choices; pay attention to who is doing the work; pay attention to outcomes. #overview

+ [Public. Open. Particpatory.](https://popjournal.ca/) On open scholarship, 5 volumes, several excellent pieces.

+ [Digital Studies / Le champ num√©rique](https://www.digitalstudies.org/) Journal of the Canadian Society for Digital Humanities. Lots of fantastic stuff in here.
