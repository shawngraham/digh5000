None of this is gospel; it represents merely a _starting point_. One helpful thing to do when you are given a set of possibilities like this is to drop them into something like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com), [Open Alex](https://openalex.org/), or [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/) (there are other options) to see who has cited a work, and how it has been used.

## Overview

[Reviews in DH](https://reviewsindh.pubpub.org/) is a publication that evaluates and shares current DH projects. Explore this publication for works that are of interest to you. Pay attention to the design and technology choices; pay attention to who is doing the work; pay attention to outcomes.
