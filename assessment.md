## I'm looking for engagement, critical reflection, and experimentation.

Push yourself!

## Active engagement
Don't just take it in, be active in the class discussion. Leadership and positive contributions to the class discussion, wherever that takes place. Each session will involve hacking, poking, prodding, and otherwise doing digital humanities. We can spend time every session considering how all of this will play to the experiment as well.
