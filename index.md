title: DIGH5000 Flavours of DH
---

DIGH5000 is the introductory core course for the MA Specialization in Digital Humanities. We develop an understanding of what ‘DH’ might mean for you, in the context of your home program, through an exploration of how members of the Carleton community are pursuing their own research in/and/through DH. We meet on select Tuesday mornings throughout the Fall and Winter terms, starting October 1st. From time to time, to accommodate the schedules of participating faculty, we might have to adjust our meeting times.
