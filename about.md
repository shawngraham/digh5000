# Contact Shawn

shawn dot graham at carleton dot ca

You might find him in the [XLab](https://carleton.ca/xlab).

He's on Scholar.Social as ['electricarchaeo'](https://scholar.social/@electricarchaeo), if you have a Mastodon account. (Most of the DH world migrated to BlueSky after the great nazi take-over of Twitter. BlueSky is run by the same people who screwed up Twitter. So I'm more or less done with social media, but you might find it useful to explore what the DH folks on BlueSky get up to.)

Graham's faculty page is [here](https://carleton.ca/history/people/shawn-graham/).
