What do we mean when we say 'dh', and what does DH mean when we come from so many disparate disciplinary directions? Part of the goal for this course is to equip you with something of the historiographic background for the multiple ways of 'doing' DH. We have invited DH and DH-adjacent friends and fellow travellers throughout the year to talk with us about their own research. How does their work fit in with our evolving understanding of what 'dh' can be?

# Meeting Location

I'm going to try to run this class in a hybrid modality. I will send around a zoom link that we will use for every session. I will also be in-person on campus in the History Department Lounge (go to the 4th floor Paterson, go through the glass doors through the department lobby, turn left, end of the hall, entrance on the left). You may join via zoom or you may join me in the Lounge. 

## October 1st

Introduction - my own DH journey and what it shows about the continuing evolution of the field. Why are you here? What are you after? What do you want from DH? My goals for this class, your goals for this class, assessment, and building just to see if it works. Habits of mind that lead to DH success. Code, Coding, and Sitting with 'I don't know - yet'. StudioDH and turning our work inside-out. Setting up Topical Deep Dives and Adding to the Resource Page. DIGH5800 & Studio DH.

DH and issues of replicability, reproducibility / tools are never neutral

Try to have a static website up by today. It can be a formal personal academic space. It can be something more fun. The point is to learn the process.

## Coding for Humanities Workshop

This [workshop](https://carleton.ca/gradpd/cu-events/coding-for-the-humanities-f2024/) is being offered through the library. I've asked you to participate in it as part of DIGH5800; a few of the sessions coincide with our DIGH5000 schedule, but that's ok. I was going to do some coding with you anyway, but this will be a richer experience, so we'll rejig accordingly.
