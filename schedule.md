What do we mean when we say 'dh', and what does DH mean when we come from so many disparate disciplinary directions? Part of the goal for this course is to equip you with something of the historiographic background for the multiple ways of 'doing' DH. We have invited DH and DH-adjacent friends and fellow travellers throughout the year to talk with us about their own research. How does their work fit in with our evolving understanding of what 'dh' can be?

Building a Digital Research Environment and Why That Matters in DH / issues of replicability, reproducibility / tools are never neutral

> Generative AI is digital humanities in reverse. What we describe about the information in an archive becomes a prescription -- what was meant to be a set of notes becomes a recipe. This reversal makes digital humanities a key lens for understanding the complex cultural questions surrounding AI, but to do so, we have to get into the habit of thinking in reverse. We have to consider the consequences of the ways we organize information deliberately, & become literate about what AI systems will do to the data we gather about culture. Assume anything we record will eventually be reversed and mass-produced. How does that change the way you label, categorize, store information? What do you do differently? The opposite of digital humanities -- issues around the preservation of scarce originals are displaced by the mass production of simulated derivatives.
