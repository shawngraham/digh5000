What do we mean when we say 'dh', and what does DH mean when we come from so many disparate disciplinary directions? Part of the goal for this course is to equip you with something of the historiographic background for the multiple ways of 'doing' DH. We have invited DH and DH-adjacent friends and fellow travellers throughout the year to talk with us about their own research. How does their work fit in with our evolving understanding of what 'dh' can be?
