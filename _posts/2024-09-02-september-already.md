The fact that it's now September boggles my mind. 

Ah well.

For reference, I'll slap any supporting visuals for the course under the 'slides' folder with the naming convention 'monthDay', so:

[Sept 4](../../../slides/oct1): thus `https://shawngraham.github.io/digh5000/slides/oct1`

...and so on.
